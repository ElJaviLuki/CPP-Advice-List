# CPP-Advice-List
Recopilation of all the advice lists in "The C++ Programming Language" book by Bjarne Stroustrup. 

Please, buy "The C++ Programming Language" book (Bjarne Stroustup) to expand your C++ knowledge.

NOTE:
Each  chapter  contains  an  ‘‘Advice’’ section  with  a  set  of  concrete  recommendations  related  to  its
contents.   Such advice  consists  of  rough  rules  of  thumb,  not  immutable  laws.   A piece  of  advice
should be applied only where reasonable.  There is no substitute for intelligence, experience, common sense, and good taste.
I  find  rules  of  the  form  ‘‘never  do  this’’  unhelpful.   Consequently,  most  advice  is  phrased  as
suggestions  for  what  to  do.  Negative  suggestions  tend  not  to  be  phrased  as  absolute  prohibitions
and I try to suggest alternatives.  I know of no major feature of C++ that I have not seen put to good
use.  The ‘‘Advice’’ sections do not contain explanations.  Instead, each piece of advice is accompa-
nied by a reference to an appropriate section of the book.
